# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

Mockup of the University of Utah TA application website that allows for users to login/create an account, see the list of current coures taking TA's, apply and create an application & profile to apply to be course TA's. Along with this are more robust features for admin / professor (user roles) that allow them to view applications, enrollments over time (HighCharts Javascript framework), CRUD properties and actions (database management), and AWS server deployment.
